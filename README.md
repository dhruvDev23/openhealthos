OpenHealthOS is a **local-first, privacy-respecting personal health operating system**. It is designed to empower individuals to own, manage, and analyze their health, fitness, and physiological data without relying on cloud servers or compromising privacy.

## Features (Core Backend)
The foundation of OpenHealthOS is a robust, extensible SQLite data warehouse that currently supports tracking:
- **Activities**: Workouts, durations, and activity types.
- **Sleep Sessions**: Sleep duration and quality tracking.
- **HRV Readings**: Heart Rate Variability tracking for recovery metrics.
- **Nutrition Logs**: Calorie and macronutrient (protein) tracking.
- **Body Metrics**: Weight, resting heart rate, and VO2 Max.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Database**: SQLite (Local-first architecture)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
